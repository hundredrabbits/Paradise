Snaking upward and above the square is the glass veranda, overlooking the city center. Archives of rare artifacts and instruments, the geometry pavilion hides beneath the main street.

The deepest perceptible fabric has revealed to us, its building blocks to be letters, a set of characters with which we can build anything. Assembling into words untruthful, extraparadistical and foreign shapes never beheld in our world.. Our consciousness, residing unobservably between our eternaly unmoving static pages. Could it be that we find ourselves in a mere interactive fiction?. The note appears to be lost in thoughts.

Go back to the pink library, enter chaos, then enter the factions. You will see the factions there, enter a faction or create one. If you create a faction mark it "the faction" so people know it is a faction.

Where the keep's domed roof should be, a barrel cactus grows instead. The east tower has been abandoned to a saltwater kraken , but the keep is swarming with courtiers about their business.

The earth is pitted with crevasse after crevasse, and wormy caverns have been eroded into the walls. Even the riverbed is dry.

All evidence shows that this place was positively overwhelmed by insatiable coral, which gave way to sand and dust . Some say even the most listless sand of this place might have unholy potency.

Closer inspection reveals invisible, corrupted insects hard at work. Their home is littered with toxic pollutants , but they don't seem to care.

A globeshaped birdcage hangs from one hook. An intermittent lantern hangs from the other. Bats coat the cave ceiling in a furry mass, as the caverns continue into a dark, distant network .

At the center is the great warroom of the Salty Keep. An iron catwalk rims the cactus. From there, soldiers can pluck enormous spines to use as weapons, which can be fired through the holes.

Golden glimmers coat the inner surface of the shell. Thick polyhedrons of gold are studded everywhere, sometimes smoothed by sand.

Thus it has remained intact. The holy granite tunnels retain a small amount of water, though the level is variable. Different things are revealed at the highwater mark and the lowtide point .

Occasionally, you spot a patch of bioluminescent life in the still water. The dark pools , utter silence, and your calm stride create an eerie effect.

It is dry. Following a short tunnel is an inaccessible cavern , wide and promising many wonders. It cannot be reached without bypassing a nearly impenetrable coralwall that blocks your path.

Its marauding core entombs four massive vessels, all gesturing defiantly. A towering mudstained behemoth. An eight legged castle of rusty steel. A flying multimast frigate. A needlessly complex gorgon mech.

There is a ragged nest or two, of course, and some windblown litter, but overall the hedge wall is nothing unusual. Its only interesting feature lies at the center - the savage garden .

Danger lurks in every corner - for small animals. A cluster of flytraps rises from a jagged ravine bisecting the garden's center. A pretty stone bridge crosses it, with elegant pitcherplants hanging down. A variety of plants call the sundew swamp home .

SNAP - there's one less fly now. Five oblong rocks sink slowly into the swamp , with the carnivorous plants clustered tightly around. The runes on the stones have been erased by erosion .

You tread carefully, for one misstep could sink you into the inky mire or trap you forever among the giant sundew heads . The Sundew Swamp is no place for the unwary, but its ancient ruins are an archaeological treasure .

A threadbare tapestry adorns one ruined wall. A lilac bush grows out of a swampy pothole . The royal hallway is still intact to the east.

A presence moves in the soapstone walls , watching you, waiting for his moment to come. As the hallway continues, it falls to ruin, but someone has erected a blanket fort at its end.

Unearthly technologies rise from the sandy floor , blinking and flickering. Someone has tacked blueprints to the blanket walls , and installed a cardboard box in the corner, covered in intricate crayon sketches .

They do not bend with the blows of an enemy rather, they shatter to absorb the full energy of the blow and reform at a whispered command. A twinkling light seems to beckon you, floating up in the knight's helm.

Memories of those lost, of victory in battle, of men who stood for something. At the base of the plant is a stone sword .

At its pommel is a multifaceted ruby . Along its razor sharp blade of grey stone is etched an inscription, "The true zealot never mentions the gods, but knows they are waiting."

There are potato farms , a desert of tall minarets , a clawed mountain , and a vast market of colorful stalls . You happen to glance at the red sky, and see a pair of huge eyes watching you from the real world.

An airship circles, filling the air with gentle noises. Below, the Senarkin Caverns descend into the depths of the earth, protected by the mountain. Where the "fingers" of the craggy mountain meet, a little mountain community has set up.
