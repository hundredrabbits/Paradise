# Paradise

[Paradise](http://wiki.xxiivv.com/paradise) plays like an [interactive fiction novel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gmMVjHJ6cU), in an ever-changing world where you are not an avatar but a force acting upon words - moving around and into your other selves, threading through chaos.

_“I have always imagined that Paradise will be a kind of library.”_ — Jorge Luis Borges

## Scripting

Paradise has a small [lisp dialect](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/Lain) that allows for basic scripting, you can find the list of functions [here](https://github.com/hundredrabbits/Paradise/blob/master/scripts/lain.library.js). If you would like to display the name of acting vessel for example.

```
note you are the (host) in the (host:parent). # you are the ghost in the house.
```

You can access class methods like this:

```
note you carry (len (host:inventory)) items.
```

You can also do basic math like:

```
note (mul 4 (add 2 1))
```
