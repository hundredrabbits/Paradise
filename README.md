# Paradise

[Paradise](http://wiki.xxiivv.com/paradise) plays like an [interactive fiction novel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gmMVjHJ6cU), in an ever-changing world where you are not an avatar but a force acting upon words - moving around and into your other selves, threading through chaos.

As an experiment, this project now includes a LISP-like language, called [Wildcards](WILDCARDS.md), hoping to add the missing features in building a small, fast and flexible file-system for a Linux Distro, called [Paradise OS](https://github.com/neauoire/ParadiseOS).

_“I have always imagined that Paradise will be a kind of library.”_ — Jorge Luis Borges
